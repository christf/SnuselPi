the goal of this project is creating an intelligent alarm-clock-replacement:
* deciding the wakeup-time based on reading an ics-calendar
* taking into account the current sleep-phase (motion detection)
* gentle wakeup by using light-system before using audio-alarm
* Fallback (works like a regular alarm-clock) in case of power-outage
* audio player
* night-light / mood-light
* sensor-input (temperature, humidity)
* monitor movement-data
